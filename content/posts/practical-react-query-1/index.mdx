In part 1, we will learn about React Quey tips and tricks: the `useQuery` hook

### Standard Example

Your query can be in one of the following states:

- `success`: Your query was successful, and you have data for it
- `error`: Your query did not work, and an error is set
- `loading`: Your query has no data and is currently loading for the first time

Most examples look something like this:

```tsx:title=standard-example
const todos = useTodos()

if (todos.isLoading) {
  return 'Loading...'
}
if (todos.error) {
  return 'An error has occurred: ' + todos.error.message
}

return <div>{todos.data.map(renderTodo)}</div>
```

### React Query is NOT a data fetching library

React Query can't answer the following questions:

- How can I define a baseURL with React Query ?
- How can I access response headers with React Query?
- How can I make graphQL requests with React Query?

React Query doesn't care! Just somehow return a Promise, please.

### Lab Excercise: Use the React Query DevTools

Query State = `loading` | `stale` | `fresh`

Anh thấy mọi người trong team vẫn chưa chú trọng sử dụng Dev Tool.

Cung cấp thông tin về số lượng, trạng thái và cả dữ liệu bên trong (sử dụng chung với option throttle network)

### Initial data fetch ≠ background refetch

Use SOC Portal to demo. Mặc dù nhìn trên giao diện khi đổi qua đổi lại các trang, dữ liệu có vẻ không thay đổi nhưng ở bên dưới đang có background refetch khá nhiều.

<FetchingComparison />

### Avoid mounts in different render cycle

React Query automatically deduplicate requests that would happen at the same time.

```tsx:title=only-one-network-request
export const useUserList1 = () =>
  useQuery({ queryKey: ["users"], queryFn: getUsers });

export const useUserList2 = () =>
  useQuery({ queryKey: ["users"], queryFn: getUsers });

function ComponentOne() {
  const { data } = useUserList1()
}

function ComponentTwo() {
  // ✅ will get exactly the same data as ComponentOne
  const { data } = useUserList2()
}

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <ComponentOne />
      <ComponentTwo />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  )
}
```

React Query can't deduplicate with mounts in different render cycle.

```tsx:title=two-network-request-on-first-mount
export const useUserList1 = () =>
  useQuery({ queryKey: ["users"], queryFn: getUsers });

function ComponentOne() {
  const { data } = useUserList1()

  if (data) {
    // ⚠️ mounts conditionally, only after we already have data
    return <ComponentTwo />
  }
  return <Loading />
}

function ComponentTwo() {
  // ⚠️ will thus trigger a second network request
  const { data } = useUserList1()
}

```

### The enabled option is very powerful

Use CodeSandbox and MonoRepo?

The `useQuery` hook has many options that you can pass in to customize its behaviour, and the enabled option is a very powerful one that enables you to do many cool things (pun intended). Here is a short list of things that we were able to accomplish thanks to this option:

- **Dependent Queries** <br/>
  Fetch data in one query and have a second query only run once we have successfully obtained data from the first query.

- **Wait for user input** <br/>
  Have some filter criteria in the query key, but disable it for as long as the user has not applied their filters.

- **Turn queries on and off** <br/>
  We have one query that polls data regularly thanks to refetchInterval, but we can temporarily pause it if a Modal is open to avoid updates in the back of the screen.

```tsx:title=two-network-request-on-first-mount {5,13}
 const userQuery = useQuery<User, Error>(
    ["users", userId],
    () => getUser(userId!),
    {
      enabled: userId != null
    }
  );

  const postsQuery = useQuery<Post, Error>(
    ["posts", userQuery.data?.id ?? 0],
    () => getPost(userQuery.data?.id ?? 0),
    {
      enabled: userQuery.isSuccess
    }
  );

```
