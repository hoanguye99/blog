Based on my personal experience of over 2-3 projects and findings on the internet, data-centric application frontends are divided into 5 big modules.

## My React Tech Stack

- [React Core and NextJS Core](react-core): states, effects, rendering, routes, ...
- [Styling Module](): CSS, accessibility, design system
- [Form Module](): user inputs text number dates, mutations
- [Client State Management](client-state-vs-server-state)
- [Server State Management](client-state-vs-server-state)

## Why React?

Lets look at the web world before React with jQuery and PHP:

Let's look at the problems:

- DOM mutations are expensive. This will lead to janky experience or unresponsive pages.
- Links to other pages will reload the whole browser, really slow ... [BIDV](https://www.bidv.net/bidvorg/service/)

React came out in 2013 with SPA architecture, and it has a Virtual DOM to minimize DOM update.
